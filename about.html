            <p>2016 Kid Cudi dropped an album, didn't go well due to music genre differences betwwen his Hip Hop influence and this new Alternative album he was putting out to the world. I didn't care i supported him no matter what to the fullest and didn't care what people said about the album because in the end he is just a great artist and my #1 favorite artist of all time. First time ive ever had a meet and greet for Cudi and i bought the ticket on the spot just to make sure i see the person who inspired me on so many levels in life. Forwarding to me meeting him, i cried, made me feel good inside to someone you look up to tell you everything is going to be ok. Best day of my life.</p>
